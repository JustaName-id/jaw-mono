 * Repair the token metadata viem could not pin down, for the two shapes where it renders wrong.
 *
 * viem infers `decimals` as `Number(decimals() ?? 1)` when either `decimals()` or `tokenURI(0)`
 * answers, and `undefined` when both revert. That misses:
 *
 * - **ERC-721s**, which arrive as `1` (one NFT would render as "0.1") or as `undefined`, which
 *   `mapAssetChanges` drops. ERC-165 separates them from a genuine 1-decimal ERC-20.
 * - **0-decimal ERC-20s**, which arrive as `undefined` because viem's `tokenURI_ || decimals_`
 *   guard reads a `0n` result as falsy — so a real transfer vanishes from the preview. Reading
 *   `decimals()` ourselves recovers it.
 *
 * Only those two shapes are suspects, so a batch of tokens with readable non-1 decimals asks
 * nothing extra. When it does ask, every probe rides in one `eth_simulateV1` — one request
 * whatever the candidate count — with `batch` replayed in the block ahead of them.
 *
 * That replay is what makes the answers match the amounts. viem reads its own `decimals` and
 * `tokenURI` *after* the batch has run, so a token the batch itself brings into existence —
 * deployed in the batch, or a proxy the batch initializes — answers viem and would revert on a
 * probe against the base block. viem then reports `decimals: 1` (its `tokenURI` answered) while
 * ERC-165 finds no code, and the NFT renders as "0.1": the exact defect this function exists to
 * remove. Replaying costs the batch's execution a third time and nothing else — `blockNumber` is
 * pinned, so the replay cannot diverge from the run the balances came from.
 *
 * A suspect viem reported as `1` is asked only the interface question. Its `1` is either a real
 * `decimals()` reading or viem's `?? 1` standing in for an NFT whose `tokenURI` answered, and
 * re-reading `decimals()` would tell the two apart — but acting on that is not worth it. ERC-721
 * mandates ERC-165, so the gap is limited to non-compliant NFTs, while treating a silent
 * `decimals()` as proof of one would restate a genuine 1-decimal ERC-20's amount by 10x. A
 * misread NFT count is a wrong row; a misread ERC-20 is a wrong number on a signing screen.
 *
 * Note the ERC-165 answer is the token's own claim, so a contract can opt into being counted in
 * whole units. That only rescales a row for a token the batch already touches, and `symbol` is
 * equally the token's word — the preview reports what the batch moves, not whether to trust it.
