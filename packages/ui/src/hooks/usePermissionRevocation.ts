 * twice — once in the SDK's own handler (AppSpecific) and once in the keys popup (CrossPlatform) —
 * and the copies drifted: one passed the request's address as `from`, the other the connected
 * wallet, so the popup reported `not-granter` and blocked legitimate revocations. One hook means one
 * `from`, and that class of drift can't recur.
 *
 * Unlike the execution hook, an unresolved permission BLOCKS: the revoke call is built from this
 * record, so with no data there is nothing to submit. `isBlockingRevocationProblem` encodes that.
 *
 * Callers keep their own "details loading" flag: they still fetch token metadata off the returned
 * permission, and their Confirm gate must stay closed until that lands too.
