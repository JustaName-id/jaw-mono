/**
 * What the session key may do without a human present.
 *
 * Signing is deliberately absent. A session that signs arbitrary typed data can
 * be asked for an EIP-3009 authorization or an EIP-2612 `permit` over its own
 * USDC, and neither is a call, so neither passes the x402 policy, reaches the
 * ledger, or takes the payment lock. A `permit` is the worse of the two: it
 * leaves a standing allowance, so it takes every later top-up as it arrives
 * rather than just the balance of the moment.
 *
 * Being delegated does not help. USDC routes a delegated account through
 * EIP-1271, and ERC-7739 rejects a raw signature over the plain digest, but the
 * envelope is ordinary typed data and the wrapping suffix is public (see
 * `wrappedSigner` in `x402/payer.ts`), so asking for the envelope gets the same
 * result.
 *
 * Nothing here needs it: the payer signs through its own injected signer and
 * top-ups go through `wallet_sendCalls`. A caller that wants a signature can
 * still ask for one through the browser, where a human sees what it is.
