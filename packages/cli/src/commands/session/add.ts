/**
 * Add a capability to a session without taking away the ones it has.
 *
 * `session setup` replaces a session. An agent working under a scoped session
 * that then discovers it needs to pay could only re-run setup, which revokes
 * the grant it is working under, so it loses its other capabilities in the
 * middle of the task. The alternative was hand-writing the union as one
 * `--permissions` document, which means knowing the scope you already have.
 *
 * The session still holds one permission afterwards. The union is granted as a
 * new one and the old is revoked, rather than the session tracking several,
 * because two live grants are two independent budgets on chain: two of 5 a day
 * are 10 a day, and nothing in the system represents the total. One permission
 * keeps the number on screen the number that binds.
 *
 * The key is kept, which is the point: the agent's address, its balance and its
 * delegation all survive.
