 * anyway leaves a permission that cannot be used until the account is funded and
 * the whole setup is run again, which revokes and re-grants.

 * unable to send anything.
 *
 * Scoped to the x402 preset by its caller, and it has to be. The wallet seeds in
 * whatever token the permission names, picking the first ERC-20 spend in it, and
 * a permission that authorises no spend at all is correctly seeded with nothing.
 * Reading USDC would then be reading the wrong token, or the wrong question. The
 * preset is the one grant that always names USDC.
 *
 * What it does NOT do is diagnose. `buildSpenderPrefundCall` declines for eight
 * different reasons, of which a wallet not implementing the capability is only
 * one: no exchange rate for the token, a granted allowance too small to price
 * against, a paymaster context without gas, an owner balance that no longer
 * covers the seed plus the grant's own fee. So the message states what is true
 * and observable, that the session cannot pay, and offers the causes rather than
 * asserting the one that is most often right.
