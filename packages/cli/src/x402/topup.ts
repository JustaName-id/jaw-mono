/**
 * Permission top-up (flow 2b): when the session payer EOA can't cover a
 * payment, refill it from the user's account through the granted on-chain
 * permission, then let the normal EIP-3009 payment run.
 *
 * The transfer executes as the session smart account via
 * `wallet_sendCalls(permissionId)`. `JustaPermissionManager` enforces the
 * per-token, per-period cap on-chain, so the user's keys and wallet are never
 * involved: the agent only ever receives what the permission releases.
 *
 * Gas for that transfer is charged by the ERC-20 paymaster to whoever sends the
 * userOp, which is the permission's spender, and the spender is the payer: a
 * session is one address. So every refill carries `gasReserve` on top of what
 * the payment needs, leaving the fee something to come out of and the next
 * refill something to be charged for. The first one is covered by the grant,
 * which sends the same amount to the session when the permission is approved.
 *
 * The reserve doubles as a float, since payments spend it too. A long run of
 * prices well under it can drain it, and the refill that follows is charged
 * like any other: there is nothing left that would sponsor it instead.
