/**
 * The most a grant made from this machine may ask for, set by a human.
 *
 * The flow worth having is an agent that hits a 402, asks for a budget, and a
 * human approves it in the browser. It already works, and it works by accident:
 * an agent with shell access runs `jaw session setup --x402 --limit <whatever it
 * likes>`, and the browser screen is the only thing standing between that number
 * and an approval. That makes a grant screen the entire security boundary, and
 * screens get clicked through.
 *
 * A ceiling moves the decision to where it belongs. The human names the most
 * they are willing to grant, once, at a terminal; the agent can ask for that or
 * less, and the browser confirms a number that was already bounded. It is the
 * same split the x402 caps already use: `maxPerPeriod` and the rest are
 * deliberately unreachable from the MCP tools, because an agent must not raise
 * its own spending caps.
 *
 * Unset means no ceiling, which is what every install has today.
 */

/**
 * Why the grant is more than the ceiling allows, or null when it is not.
 *
 * Two conditions, both conservative in the same direction: the allowance may not
 * exceed the ceiling's, and the period may not be shorter than the ceiling's. A
 * shorter period is more money over the same time even at the same allowance, so
 * `10/hour` is not under a `10/day` ceiling. Together they are stricter than
 * comparing rates, and they can be said in one sentence, which matters for a
 * refusal someone reads while they are trying to get work done.
 *
 * Checked against the resolved permission rather than the `--limit` string, so a
 * hand-written `--permissions` is bounded by the same number. That is the whole
 * point: a bypass an agent can reach is not a ceiling.
