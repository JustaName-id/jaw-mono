/**
 * What one row contributes to a spend cap.

 * The single definition of the rule, exported because more than one place needs

 * hand. `jaw x402 log` reports against it, and the caps enforce against it, so
 * the number a user reads and the number that refuses their next payment are
 * the same number.
 *
 * A settled payment costs what settled. A failed one costs the ceiling it
 * authorized, because an authorization that was signed and sent stays spendable
 * up to that ceiling until its nonce is consumed or its deadline passes, and
 * nothing yet proves either. Under `exact` the two figures are equal and this
 * is the rule that has always applied.
 *
 * A paid row nobody has checked costs its ceiling for that same reason. The
 * receipt is the server's own claim about how much of its own authorization it
 * took, and a claim is not evidence of itself: a fabricated hash with one base
 * unit against a thousand-unit ceiling would otherwise buy a live authorization
 * for the difference while the caps counted one. `reconcileSettlements` brings
 * the figure down to what the chain shows, one payment later.
 *
 * A row reconciled to `expired` costs nothing. Its deadline passed with its
 * nonce unconsumed, so the authorization died where it stood.
 *
 * Every parse failure reads as zero and the failed case takes the larger of the
 * two, so one unparseable field cannot shrink an enforced cap: a torn write or a
 * hand edit can only ever leave the cap where it was or higher. Negatives clamp
 * for the same reason, since `BigInt('-5')` parses fine and would otherwise
 * subtract.
