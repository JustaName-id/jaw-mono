 * The `upto` scheme on EVM: authorize a ceiling, get charged for what was used.
 *
 * The client signs a Permit2 `permitWitnessTransferFrom` for the ceiling the
 * server advertised. The facilitator later calls `x402UptoPermit2Proxy.settle`
 * with the amount the run actually consumed, and the proxy reverts with
 * `AmountExceedsPermitted` above the ceiling and with `UnauthorizedFacilitator`
 * unless the caller is the address named in the witness. So the exposure of one
 * signature is exactly the ceiling, paid to the recipient the witness names, by
 * the facilitator the witness names, once.
 *
 * Two preconditions this module does not enforce, because they are not its job:
 * the payer must have approved Permit2 on the token, and the policy must have
 * already agreed to the ceiling. Signing before either is a payment that cannot
 * settle, or one that should not have been made.
