 * against a thousand-unit ceiling, never consume the Permit2 nonce, and hold a
 * live authorization for the difference until the deadline.
 *
 * The check does not run where the receipt arrives. Not because it could not:
 * measured against a facilitator answering the instant it broadcast, the
 * receipt was queryable 194ms later. Because doing it there makes every payment
 * wait on a node inside the payment lock, which is the margin two issues of
 * this cycle just spent PRs defending, and the honest payment would be paying
 * that wait to catch the dishonest one.
 *

 * settles the question before it reads the caps. A slow node changes no number
 * and fails no payment: the row simply stays unverified and is tried again.
