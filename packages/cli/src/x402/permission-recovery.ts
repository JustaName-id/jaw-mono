/**
 * The permission struct for a session that was created before the CLI kept one.
 *
 * Those sessions hold only the id, and no view on the permission manager takes
 * an id, so every on-chain read reports "cannot tell" and `session add` refuses
 * for want of a scope to merge against. Telling people to run setup again is a
 * poor answer when the grant is recoverable: the relay stores what was granted,
 * keyed by the same hash, and `getPermissionFromRelay` returns it.
 *
 * Recovered once and written back, so this costs one GET on the first command
 * that needs it and nothing afterwards. Anything that goes wrong leaves the
 * session exactly as it was, which is the behaviour every such session had
 * before this existed: a failed recovery must not turn a working command into
 * an error.
