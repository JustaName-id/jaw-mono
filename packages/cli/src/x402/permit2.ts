/**
 * Permit2 declarations for the x402 `upto` scheme.
 *
 * `upto` does not settle through EIP-3009 the way `exact` does. The client signs
 * a Permit2 `permitWitnessTransferFrom` authorizing a ceiling, and the
 * facilitator later calls the x402 proxy with the amount the run actually
 * consumed, which the proxy refuses if it exceeds the ceiling. The witness binds
 * both the recipient and the facilitator, so a signature is not useful to anyone
 * else.
 *
 * Everything here is a declaration: the addresses, the structs, and the domain.
 * Hashing them is viem's job. Choosing a nonce, a deadline, a spender or an
 * amount, and deciding whether a challenge may be paid at all, belongs to the
 * scheme module and the policy, not to this file.

 * one would authorize a stranger to pull up to the ceiling. This is the same

 * look like. The runtime bytecode contains the witness type string and the
 * typehash below as literals, so the transcription is checked against the
 * contract that will actually run and not only against its source.
 *
 * Two traps live near this address. The x402 README still lists Base Mainnet as
 * having no `upto` deployment, which is stale. And Base Sepolia carries a second,
 * legacy proxy at `0x402039b3d6E6BEC5A02c2C9fd937ac17A6940002` with different
 * bytecode, predating the deterministic build; a challenge pointing there must
