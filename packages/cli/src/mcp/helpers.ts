/**
 * Every tool's failure path, which is also where text nobody on this side wrote
 * gets rendered to a human.
 *
 * Handlers interpolate their arguments into the reason they refuse, and those
 * arguments come from the model: `jaw_rpc` names the method it would not run,
 * `jaw_config_set` echoes the value it could not parse. Further down, a server
 * error string reaches here through the x402 paths. An agent reading a poisoned
 * page is a remote party writing that text, so it is disarmed like any other,
 * once at the boundary rather than at each site that builds a message.
 *
 * `sanitizeBlock` and not `sanitizeLine`: an error is legitimately multi-line,
 * and truncating a stack or a revert reason to fit one costs more than the
 * newline is worth. What matters is that the escape sequences, the bidi
 * overrides and the zero-width characters do not survive, and none of them do.
