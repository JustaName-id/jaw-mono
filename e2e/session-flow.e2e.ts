/**
 * Real-chain, real-approval E2E for the session commands.
 *
 * The other script (`permission-onchain.e2e.ts`) settles whether the CLI's model
 * of the contract is right, using a session that already exists. This one runs
 * the commands that create and change a session, which is the half no unit test
 * reaches: two browser approvals chained around a grant and a revoke, with a
 * config write in between, and an on-chain effect after each one.
 *
 * Semi-automated on purpose. Driving the approval would need a passkey the test
 * owns, which means an account it created, which this API key cannot register
 * (it manages no ENS domains) and which would hold no USDC to fund a grant
 * with. So the script drives the CLI and the assertions, prints the URL, and
 * waits for a person to approve with their own passkey.
 *
 * It does not touch your session. Every command runs with HOME pointed at a
 * throwaway directory, so the CLI reads and writes a scratch `~/.jaw`; the
 * session it creates is its own, and it revokes it at the end.
 *
 * It does spend: each grant carries a small USDC prefund to the session, and
 * the grant and revoke cost gas. Base Sepolia only, and the account you approve
 * with pays.
 *
 * Run:  bun e2e/session-flow.e2e.ts
 *       JAW_E2E_STEPS=setup,status bun e2e/session-flow.e2e.ts   (a subset)
 *       JAW_E2E_NO_BROWSER=1 bun e2e/session-flow.e2e.ts          (print the URL)
 *       JAW_E2E_HOME=<dir> JAW_E2E_STEPS=add bun e2e/...           (resume a run)
 * Exit: 0 on pass, 1 on failure or unmet prerequisites.
