/**
 * Real-chain E2E for the permission reads the CLI added.
 *
 * Everything else about this work is tested against mocks, which verify that
 * the code does what its author believed the contract does. That belief was
 * wrong twice while it was being written: once about whether a permission id
 * can be handed to a view (it cannot, they all take the struct), and once about
 * whether two spend limits on one token are independent budgets (they are not,
 * every one of them is charged). Both were caught by review rather than by a
 * test, because a test written from the same belief agrees with it.
 *
 * This script asks the deployed manager instead. It is read-only: `eth_call`
 * against JustaPermissionManager plus one relay GET. It spends nothing, signs
 * nothing, and changes no local state.
 *
 * What it settles, in order of how much rests on it:
 *
 *   1. The struct the CLI rebuilds hashes to the permission that was granted.
 *      Everything added here reads through `getHash` first and degrades to
 *      "cannot tell" when it does not match, so a mismatch means the whole
 *      feature is quietly inert rather than wrong. Nothing offline can tell
 *      those apart.
 *   2. `getCurrentPeriod` answers, and its window agrees with the one
 *      `currentPeriodWindow` computes locally by mirroring
 *      `_getCurrentPeriod`. Two implementations of the same calendar.
 *   3. `isApproved` / `isRevoked` answer for a live permission.
 *
 * Prerequisites: a session in ~/.jaw (any age, see the relay fallback below) on
 * a chain in the USDC registry, and an apiKey in ~/.jaw/config.json.
 *
 * Run:  bun e2e/permission-onchain.e2e.ts
 * Exit: 0 on pass, 1 on failure or unmet prerequisites.
